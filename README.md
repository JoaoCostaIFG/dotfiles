# Dotfiles

My current dotfiles and scripts. I manage these using
[DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

The scripts were written by me for me. Feel free to adapt them to your needs.

## Contents

- The **scripts** directory contents should be kept somewhere in the user's
  **PATH**;
- The dotfiles in the [homedir directory](./homedir) should be kept in the
  user's home directory;
- The dotfiles in the [dot_config directory ](./dot_config) should be kept in
  the user's `.config` directory.

**Note:** the dot (`.`) at the start of the dotfiles was replaced by `dot_`;

## Scripts

Go to the [scripts directory](./scripts) to find out more about all the scripts
(the [README.md file](./scripts/README.md) of that directory). These descriptions
are generated semi-automatically using the descriptions in the comments at the
beginning of each file. Some files maybe have the descriptions missing, because
I forgot to comment them.

### License

The scripts are licensed under an [MIT License](./LICENSE)
